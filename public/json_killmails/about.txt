Killmails in this directory were not generated in a manner in which they are accessible via the API.

Instead, CCP Swift has worked with various members of CCP to regenerate the killmail as closely as possible.

I've also asked for the following criteria in assigning an "official" killmail id:
- Must be very close to actual time of loss
- Must have been an NPC loss
- Must have been to a character that has been deleted


The file will need to be loaded, have it's killmail_id set to the proper id, and then saved to esimails.
Then, a row must be inserted into crestmails: {killID: 107220741, "hash": "CCP VERIFIED", processed: "fetched"} 
Be sure to use fetched as the status, otherwise zkill code will determine the entry to be invalid and delete it
